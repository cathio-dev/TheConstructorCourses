Ros2 control

ROS 2 Control is a powerful framework for managing robotic hardware and controllers in ROS 2, enabling precise and flexible control of robots in both simulation and real-world applications. This course provides a structured approach to learning ros2_control, from setting up controllers to creating custom hardware interfaces and controllers.
