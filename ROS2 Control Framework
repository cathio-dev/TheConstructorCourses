Ros2 control

ROS 2 Control is a powerful framework for managing robotic hardware and controllers in ROS 2, enabling precise and flexible control of robots in both simulation and real-world applications. This course provides a structured approach to learning ros2_control, from setting up controllers to creating custom hardware interfaces and controllers.

This is where the term control comes into play. Control means managing, commanding, or directing the behavior of a device, or a system of devices, to get expected results. A whole field of study called Control Theory is dedicated to studying and solving control problems.

To add ros2_control to our robot we will go through the following steps:

Create a new package
Create a configuration file for the controller manager and the control algorithms
Update the robot's description xacro file
Create a launch file that will bring up the controllers
Test the robot controlled by ros2_control

Important: the joint names that you define in this configuration file must match the joint names in the URDF/XACRO file. The YAML file above for instance, assigns a joint with name "joint1" to both controllers. "joint1" corresponds to the joint name defined by the XML tag <joint name="joint1" type="continuous"> inside the .xacro file (more on that below!).
