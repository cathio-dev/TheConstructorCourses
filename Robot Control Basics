PID control
KP = decrescment or increasement of velocity, torque, whatever is causing motion.
KP with low values, low speed but accurate.
KP high values its the opposite

Follows the rate of change, the derivate tangent

When

  increase, the derivative control is more faster to correct the error. However, unlike the proportional control, this velocity of correction is because of rate of change of the angles.

The most important feature of integral control is that, this will try to eliminate whatever stationary error. In turn, this control will be very aggressive depending on the area generated by the error

Excellent! but what do  
ω
  and  
ζ
  mean? In simple terms,  
ω
  is the oscillation generated by the control law (3), higher  
ω
  implies higher oscillation (higher oscillation in the joint to control), and  
ζ
  is the damping of the control law, higher  
ζ
  implies less velocity to reach the desired angle in the arm.
